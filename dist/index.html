        <h3>Pandas and the United States</h3> <br>
        <p>Pandas were gifted by Mao Zedong to the United States after President Nixon visited China in 1972. When they arrived, first lady at the time Pat Nixon, donated both of them to the National Zoo in Washington D.C.
           The pandas found big success in Diplomacy, as it helped China with US relations.

          <h3>Loan Policy</h3>
          <p>According to Wikipedia "In 1984, China's Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping modified the policy, such that subsequent pandas would be loaned, instead of gifted, beginning with China presenting two pandas to Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympic Games for $50,000 per month per panda. This practice was again modified in 1991 in favor of long-term loans. China began to offer pandas to other nations only on ten-year loans."
            Some of the terms that were included within this policy included fees upwards of 1 million dollars and that any cubs born during the loan period are considered property of the Republic of China.
